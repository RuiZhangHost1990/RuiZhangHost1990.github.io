Hi Everyone! My name is Rui Zhang. I received the Ph.D. degree in civil engineering from The University of Sheffield in 2020. My research interests include digital twin systems, computational geomechanics, geotechnical engineering design, application of artificial intelligence in civil engineering, underground infrastructure management, and intelligent transportation systems (ITS). I am also an Associate Fellow of the Higher Education Academy in U.K. My research goal is to develop the advanced technology for intelligent infrastructure to meet different challenges. To achieve the goal, I have some research fundamentals in three main aspects: sensing monitoring, numerical modeling, and data analytics. I first built a solid foundation of geotechnical engineering during my PhD study. Then I go beyond geotechnical engineering and conduct interdisciplinary studies. During postdoc studies, I accumulated deep knowledge of sensor technologies, structural dynamics and reliability analysis, digitalization techniques, and artificial intelligence. Based on that, I and my teammates developed noise logger-based leak diagnosis system. I also simulated tunnel as a system and coordinated a cyber-physical testbed to predict hazard effect and guide scenario planning for tunnel operations.

Research Experience
======
1.Limit analysis of unsaturated soil problems using discontinuity layout optimization under nonlinear and non-associative yield conditions:

Geotechnical stability issues often involve unpredictable natural (e.g., earthquakes) or anthropogenic hazards (e.g., blasts). Efficient numerical modeling is crucial for early hazard warning and rapid assessment, aiding engineers in designing soil structures to meet environmental and societal needs. Limit analysis is commonly used to determine collapse loads, traditionally assuming linear failure criteria and associative flow rules. However, real soils often exhibit nonlinear behavior, and associative rules overestimate volumetric strains in frictional soils, leading to unsafe designs. 
To address the challenge, I developed a new upper-bound solution for multi-wedge rigid block mechanisms in soils with nonlinear power-law failure criterion. This approach utilizes a curved interface that obeys the nonlinear yield function flow rule along its full length. The ability of the proposed nonlinear upper bound solution to collect data about the shear and normal stresses at every point along the failure surface is discussed. The issue of non-associativity is investigated in the context of discrete rigid block limit analysis. I developed new methods to obtain non-associative solutions by separately quantifying dilation and shearing friction for frictional materials.

2.Smart noise logger-based leak diagnosis system and consultancy study on modeling of failure of ferrous water mains:

The research on pipe failure diagnosis and modeling enhances Hong Kong's Water Distribution Networks (HKWDN) by improving leak/burst prediction and maintenance efficiency. This project benefits academics, contractors, and municipal personnel by providing AI-driven models for failure prediction and analyzing soil impact on pipe integrity. As a key researcher, I focus on leak detection using wavelet transforms and decomposition techniques on sensor data (Noise logger, Accelerometer). I collect and analyze acoustic signals, extract features with AI-based methods, and develop leak location solutions using R-Studio, RapidMiner, and Python for deep learning. Additionally, I model soil-pipe interactions to support water infrastructure management.

3.A smart digital twin framework using advanced modelling and data analytics for monitoring and management of city-scale underground transportation infrastructure:

This project aims to develop advanced digital modeling and analytics for a smart digital twin framework to diagnose, predict, and manage faults in underground transportation infrastructure. Singapore’s LTA requires innovative methods to maintain tunnel efficiency and integrity, as conventional inspections are limited in diagnosing faults. My role is to create a digital twin solution for fault detection, performance prediction, and decision-making. I established a cyber-physical loop connecting simulations with real structures and developed heterogeneous models to capture complex tunnel behaviors.

Now I am working in the research project: 'Digital twin of processes for construction of buildings' in Aalto University. And I am trying to create a realistic simulation model of the construction process and connect it to an automated sensing system of construction status to form the digital twin.
